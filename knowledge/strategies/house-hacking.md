# House Hacking Strategy Guide

## What is House Hacking?

House hacking is a real estate investment strategy where you live in a property while renting out part of it to offset (or eliminate) your housing costs. The rental income from tenants covers your mortgage, taxes, and insurance—allowing you to live for free or at a significantly reduced cost while building equity.

It's often called the "gateway strategy" to real estate investing because it:
- Requires less capital than traditional investment properties
- Qualifies for owner-occupied financing (lower down payments, better rates)
- Reduces risk by having you on-site
- Teaches landlord skills with training wheels

## Types of House Hacks

### 1. Small Multifamily (Duplex, Triplex, Quadplex)
**How it works**: Buy a 2-4 unit property, live in one unit, rent the others.

**Pros**:
- Clear separation between your space and tenants
- Often the best cash flow potential
- Each unit is a self-contained rental when you move out
- FHA loans allow up to 4 units with 3.5% down

**Cons**:
- Higher purchase prices than single-family
- More competition from investors
- More management complexity

**Best for**: People who want privacy and clear boundaries with tenants.

### 2. Single-Family with Rentable Space
**How it works**: Buy a house with a basement apartment, ADU (accessory dwelling unit), or in-law suite. Live in the main house, rent the separate space.

**Pros**:
- Feels more like a "normal" home
- Often easier to find than multifamily
- ADU may have separate entrance for privacy

**Cons**:
- May share walls/utilities with tenant
- Less cash flow than multifamily usually
- ADU legality varies by jurisdiction

**Best for**: People who want a house-like feel with passive income.

### 3. Rent-by-Room
**How it works**: Buy a larger single-family home and rent out individual bedrooms while living in one yourself.

**Pros**:
- Highest cash flow potential per dollar invested
- Losing one tenant doesn't eliminate all income
- Single-family homes often cheaper than multifamily

**Cons**:
- Least privacy—you share common spaces
- More management intensive
- Tenant turnover can be higher

**Best for**: Young investors prioritizing wealth building over comfort.

### 4. Short-Term Rental Hybrid
**How it works**: Live in part of a property and Airbnb the rest (spare bedrooms, basement, ADU).

**Pros**:
- Higher income potential than long-term rentals
- More flexibility—can stop hosting when you want
- In desirable areas, can be very lucrative

**Cons**:
- More work (turnover, cleaning, communication)
- Income is less predictable
- May have regulatory restrictions

**Best for**: Hospitality-minded investors in tourist-friendly areas.

## Financing Your House Hack

### FHA Loans (Most Common for House Hackers)
- **Down payment**: 3.5%
- **Requirements**: Credit score 580+ (higher is better), must be owner-occupied
- **Occupancy requirement**: Must live there as primary residence for 12 months
- **Property types**: 1-4 units
- **Catch**: PMI (mortgage insurance) required

**Example**: On a $300,000 duplex, your down payment would be $10,500 instead of $60,000 (20% conventional).

### Conventional Loans
- **Down payment**: 5-20% (lower rates with 20%+)
- **Benefits**: No PMI with 20% down, fewer restrictions
- **When to use**: If you have more capital or want to avoid PMI

### VA Loans (Veterans/Active Military)
- **Down payment**: 0%
- **Property types**: 1-4 units
- **Huge advantage**: Best terms available if you qualify

### FHA 203(k) Loans
- **Purpose**: Finance purchase + renovation in one loan
- **Use case**: Fixer-upper house hacks
- **Note**: More paperwork, requires approved contractors

## Making the Numbers Work

### The Goal: Live for Free (or Close to It)

**Basic formula**:
```
Rental Income - (Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Expenses) = Your Housing Cost
```

If that equals $0 or positive, you're living for free while building equity.

### Example: Durham Duplex House Hack

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Purchase Price** | $350,000 |
| **Down Payment (FHA 3.5%)** | $12,250 |
| **Closing Costs** | $10,000 |
| **Total Cash Needed** | ~$22,250 |

| Monthly Numbers | Amount |
|-----------------|--------|
| Mortgage Payment (P&I) | $2,100 |
| Property Taxes | $250 |
| Insurance | $150 |
| PMI | $175 |
| Repairs/Reserves | $200 |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$2,875** |

| Income | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Unit B Rent | $1,500 |
| **Your Net Housing Cost** | **$1,375** |

In this example, you're not living for free, but you're paying $1,375/month to live in a duplex unit AND build equity in a $350k asset. Compare that to renting a similar unit for $1,500+/month with zero equity building.

**When you move out**: Both units rent for $1,500 = $3,000/month income. Now it's a cash-flowing investment property.

## Finding House Hack Properties

### What to Look For

**Property characteristics**:
- Separate entrances for tenant units (reduces friction)
- Updated or rentable units (avoid needing immediate work)
- Good bones (roof, HVAC, foundation in decent shape)
- Conforming layout (weird layouts hurt resale and rent)

**Location factors**:
- Near employment centers or universities (tenant demand)
- Low crime areas (tenant retention, your safety)
- Good school districts (resale value, family renters)
- Public transit access (in Triangle: near bus lines, future BRT)

**Deal-breakers to avoid**:
- Foundation issues
- Major deferred maintenance
- High crime areas
- HOAs that restrict rentals

### Where to Search

- **MLS** (through your agent): Most inventory
- **Zillow/Redfin**: Good for initial research
- **BiggerPockets Forums**: Off-market leads sometimes
- **Driving for Dollars**: Look for "tired" properties
- **Direct mail**: Letters to multifamily owners

## House Hacking in the Triangle Market

### Why the Triangle is Good for House Hacking

**Demand drivers**:
- Research Triangle Park: Major tech employers (IBM, Cisco, Google, Apple)
- Universities: Duke, UNC, NC State, Durham Tech
- Healthcare: Duke Health, UNC Health, WakeMed
- Growing population: One of the fastest-growing metros in the US

**Renter demographics**:
- Young professionals
- Graduate students and medical residents
- Traveling nurses and contractors
- Remote workers attracted by quality of life

### Triangle-Specific Considerations

**Durham**:
- More affordable than Raleigh
- Strong rental demand near Duke, downtown
- Gentrifying neighborhoods offer appreciation potential
- Good inventory of older duplexes and homes with basements
- Neighborhoods to research: Old North Durham, Walltown, Trinity Park, Lakewood

**Raleigh**:
- Larger market, more expensive
- Strong job growth near downtown and North Hills
- Fewer "natural" house hacks (more suburban SFH layout)
- Consider areas near NC State for rent-by-room

**Chapel Hill/Carrboro**:
- Highest price points
- Excellent rental demand (UNC)
- Strict ADU regulations to research
- May be priced out for first-time investors

### Typical Numbers (as of knowledge date)

| Property Type | Price Range | Rent per Unit |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Duplex (Durham) | $300k - $500k | $1,200 - $1,800 |
| Triplex (Durham) | $400k - $650k | $1,000 - $1,500 |
| SFH with basement apt | $280k - $450k | $800 - $1,200 (apt) |
| Room rental (near Duke) | N/A | $600 - $900/room |

*Note: Market changes quickly. Verify current numbers with fresh research.*

## Risks and How to Mitigate Them

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bad tenants | Screen thoroughly, trust your gut, require references |
| Vacancy | Keep rents at market rate, maintain property well |
| Unexpected repairs | Keep 3-6 months reserves, get inspection before buying |
| Market downturn | Buy for cash flow, not just appreciation |
| Overleveraging | Conservative underwriting, stress-test your numbers |
| Tenant conflicts | Clear lease terms, professional boundaries, separate entrances |

## The House Hacking Path to Financial Independence

### Year 1-2: First House Hack
- Buy a duplex or home with rentable space
- Live there for 12 months (FHA requirement)
- Learn landlord basics while having close oversight
- Save aggressively from reduced housing cost

### Year 2-3: Second House Hack
- Move into a new property (can use FHA again after 12 months in most cases)
- First property becomes full rental with positive cash flow
- Repeat the process

### Year 4+: Scale Up
- After 2-3 house hacks, you own multiple properties
- Rental income starts to compound
- Can transition to conventional investment loans
- Or continue house hacking if it suits your lifestyle

### The Math of House Hacking Wealth

If you house hack once per year for 5 years in the Triangle:
- 5 properties owned
- ~$50-100k equity built per property (appreciation + mortgage paydown)
- $500-1,000/month cash flow per property when rented
- Total: $250k-500k net worth built, $2,500-5,000/month passive income

*This assumes moderate appreciation and good deal selection. Results vary.*
