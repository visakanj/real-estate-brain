## Episode Overview
Craig Curelop shares his journey from sleeping on an air mattress in his living room to owning multiple properties through aggressive house hacking. The episode covers practical strategies for beginners, including how to find house hack-able properties, financing options, and mindset shifts needed to make it work. Highly relevant for our team since house hacking is our planned first strategy.

## Key Insights

### 1. House Hacking is the "Cheat Code" for First-Time Investors
Craig argues that house hacking is the lowest-risk, highest-return strategy for beginners because you're solving your housing problem while building equity. Even if you only break even on cash flow, you're essentially living for free while someone else pays your mortgage.

### 2. The Comfort Spectrum Matters
There's a range of house hacking intensity:
- **Luxury**: Duplex where you live in one unit (most comfortable)
- **Moderate**: Single family with basement or ADU rented out
- **Aggressive**: Rent by the room strategy (least comfortable, highest returns)

Your returns scale inversely with comfort. Craig slept on an air mattress to maximize his returns—but that's not necessary. Find your comfort level and optimize within it.

### 3. FHA Loans Are Your Best Friend
With only 3.5% down, FHA loans make house hacking accessible. The catch: you must live there for 12 months. But after that, you can move out (into your next house hack) and convert it to a rental.

### 4. Look for "Forced Appreciation" Opportunities
The best house hacks have upside: properties where you can add a bedroom, finish a basement, or build an ADU. This lets you increase rental income and property value simultaneously.

## Actionable Takeaways

Things we should consider doing based on this episode:

- [ ] Calculate our "live-in" housing costs now vs. potential house hack scenarios
- [ ] Research FHA loan requirements and get pre-approved
- [ ] Start looking at duplexes and triplexes in Durham with one unit we'd live in
- [ ] Consider rent-by-room numbers for larger single-family homes
- [ ] Look for properties with ADU potential or unfinished basements

## Relevant to Our Situation

This strategy is perfect for where we are. We're currently renting, so our housing cost is pure expense. If we house hack, we could redirect that expense toward building equity. The Triangle market has good inventory of older homes with basement apartments or duplex conversions that could work.

Specific to Durham: Craig mentioned college towns are excellent for house hacking because of steady renter demand. Duke and nearby universities create consistent demand for rentals.

## Quotes Worth Remembering

> "Your first house hack doesn't need to be your dream home. It needs to be your wealth-building vehicle. Dream homes come later, funded by the wealth you build now."
> — Craig Curelop

> "Most people spend 30-40% of their income on housing and call it 'normal.' House hackers spend 0% and call it 'investing.' Same dollar amount, completely different outcome."
> — Craig Curelop

> "The best time to house hack is when you're young and flexible. The second best time is now."
> — Craig Curelop

## My Rating & Notes

**Relevance to us**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 - directly applicable to our strategy)
**Recommend for team**: [x] Must listen / [ ] Worth it / [ ] Skip it

**Personal notes**:
This episode confirmed house hacking should be our first move. Craig's story is motivating but I appreciated that he was honest about the trade-offs. The "comfort spectrum" concept is helpful—we need to discuss as a team where we fall on that spectrum.

I want to run numbers on some Durham duplexes to see what "living for free" would actually look like in our market. Also curious about the rent-by-room strategy near Duke—could be very lucrative if we're willing to manage more tenants.
